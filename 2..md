## Problem Statement
Write $\frac{1}{1\cdot2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot3} + \frac{1}{3\cdot4} + \dots + \frac{1}{99\cdot100}$ as a fraction in its lowest terms
## Thoughts/Observations
1. I've seen a similar problem before, so the first idea that occurred to me is to experiment with portions of the series while attempting to see the pattern when we increase this portion.
	1. Doing so you easily realize that the first two terms is equal to $\frac{2}{3}$ and in general the first n terms of the series is equal to $\frac{n}{n+1}$
## Solution attempt
Proof by induction:
It is true for the first case $\frac{1}{2}$
Presuming $\frac{n-1}{n}$ as the sum of the first $n-1$ elements. By adding the next term $n$, we have: $$\begin{align}\text{sum till } n &= \frac{n-1}{n} + \frac{1}{n\cdot (n+1)}\\&=\frac{(n+1)\cdot (n-1) + 1}{n\cdot (n+1)}\\&=\frac{n^2}{n\cdot (n+1)}\\&=\frac{n}{n+1}\\\blacksquare\end{align}$$
As such the final answer is simply $\frac{99}{100}$.
## Comments
What stood out was the use of induction but even before that it was clear because experimented with the series in step. It is useful to use that to determine a pattern.
