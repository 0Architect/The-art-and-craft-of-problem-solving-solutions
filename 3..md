## Problem Statement
A census-taker knocks on a door, and asks the woman inside how many children she has and how old they are. "I have three daughters, their ages are whole numbers, and the product of the ages is 36," says the mother. "That's not enough information," responds the census-taker. "I'd tell you the sum of their ages, but you'd still be stumped." "I wish you'd tell me something more." "Okay, my oldest daughter Annie likes dogs." What are the ages of the three daughters? 
## Thoughts/Observations
Solved this particular problem multiple times before so quite simple. They key is to generate possibilities based on the information provided. After which with each new subsequent information, knockout impossibilities.
## Solution attempt
1. She has three children, with positive integer ages, and their product is 36.
	1. The children are thus aged 1 to $\infty$
	2. We also have $a\cdot b\cdot c = 36$
	3. From the above we can also deduce that they must be the factors of 36 so:
		$$ \begin{array}{ccc} \textbf{a} & \textbf{b} & \textbf{c} \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 36 \\ \hline 1 & 2 & 18 \\ \hline 1 & 3 & 12 \\ \hline 1 & 4 & 9 \\ \hline 1 & 6 & 6 \\ \hline 2 & 2 & 9 \\ \hline 2 & 3 & 6 \\ \hline 3 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline\end{array} $$

2. *"That's not enough information*. Naturally, we see the number of possibilities present
3. *"I'd tell you the sum of their ages, but you'd still be stumped."* Implying that among the factors, any sum that appears once is invalid, because otherwise he wouldn't have been stumped. 
	So we have: $$ \begin{array}{cccc} \textbf{a} & \textbf{b} & \textbf{c} & \textbf{sum} \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 36 &=38\\ \hline 1 & 2 & 18 &=21 \\ \hline 1 & 3 & 12 &=16\\ \hline 1 & 4 & 9 &=14 \\ \hline 1 & 6 & 6 &=13 \\ \hline 2 & 2 & 9 &=13 \\ \hline 2 & 3 & 6 &=11 \\ \hline 3 & 3 & 4 &=10 \\ \hline\end{array} $$ The options remaining are: $$ \begin{array}{cccc} \textbf{a} & \textbf{b} & \textbf{c} & \textbf{sum} \\ \hline 1 & 6 & 6 &=13\\ \hline 2 & 2 & 9 &=13 \\ \hline \end{array}$$
4. The last useful statement, "*Okay, my oldest daughter Annie likes dogs.*" Implies that there is a largest number, and from the values remaining it is easy to see what the final answer is:
	$\text{9 2 2}$
## Comments
A fairly simple problem. I utilized the strategy of generating feasible possibilities and knocking them out based on new information. Other problems may be of similar make, however, the information required to knock out the possibilities are rarely explicitly provided as they were here.
