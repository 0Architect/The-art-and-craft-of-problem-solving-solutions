## Problem Statement
I invite 10 couples to a party at my house. I ask everyone present, including my wife, how many people they shook hands with. It turns out that everyone questioned-I didn't question myself, of course-shook hands with a different number of people. If we assume that no one shook hands with his or her partner, how many people did my wife shake hands with? (I did not ask myself any questions.)
## Thoughts/Observations
What comes to mind is to minimize the problem can we solve the simplest case? So what happens when there are just 2 couples in question? After which can we generalize as we increase the number of couples? With just 1 couple, my wife obviously shook 0 persons. With 2 couples, I asked 3 people. Since each shook different people, we have 0,1,2 persons. (It can't be 3 or more because it implies someone shook hands with at least everyone else but no one is allowed to shake hands with their partners).

To move forwards with our analysis, let's see what must be true about each person. For the person that shook 2 people, he shook the other couple. The person that shook one person shook one person in the other couple. The person that shook 0 is an interesting case, because handshakes go both ways (which in my opinion is the key insight), it means no one shook hands with him. Since the second person shook hand with every member of the second couple it must be the case that the guy that shook no one is the partner. Which leaves just the person that shook hands with one person as my wife.
## Solution attempt
I can generalize the idea above quite easily. We can't have someone shake $(n-1)$ persons cause he will shake his partner. Which leaves $0\ldots n-2$ as the numbers in consideration. For ease of identification let's label them $0\ldots n-2$ with respect to the number of people they shook. $0$ has to be partners with $n-2$, because $0$ shakes no one and $n-2$ shakes everyone but his partner. Furthermore, if we pair $0$ and $n-2$ we can remove the number of persons each person shook. Why? Because $n-2$ shook every body remaining, so not counting his handshake we can remove one from each person. leaving us with $0\ldots n-3$ remaining, which (again we've moved $0$ and $n-2$ aside) allows us to use the logic above to pair and remove accordingly. So each person gets paired like so: 
$(0, n-2), (1, n-3)\ldots(\lfloor{\frac{n-1}{2}}\rfloor - 1,\lceil{\frac{n-1}{2}}\rceil)$, $n-1$ because we are also counting $0$
If you follow the pairing the only one without a pair, is the middle value. $n$ is always odd. The value for the middle number is given as $\lfloor{\frac{n-1}{2}}\rfloor$. For our purposes that is $\lfloor{\frac{10-1}{2}}\rfloor$ giving us. Our wife shook hands with four perople.
## Comments
The problem is interesting. I feel the key insight was that handshakes go both ways. The technique that worked was solving the simplest case and trying to generalize as I increase the size, by looking at what is true for each element of the sequence under consideration.
